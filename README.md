# Multiple-Linear-Regression

This code performs Multiple Linear Regression to predict the profit of startups based on various independent variables. Here's an explanation of what the code does:

Importing Libraries: The code starts by importing necessary Python libraries, including NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib for data visualization, and Pandas for data manipulation.

Importing the Dataset: The dataset '50_Startups.csv' is read using Pandas, and the data is stored in the variables X and y. X contains the independent variables, and y contains the dependent variable (profit).

One-Hot Encoding Categorical Data: The code uses scikit-learn's OneHotEncoder and ColumnTransformer to one-hot encode the categorical column in the dataset. Column 3 is the categorical column that contains information about the state in which each startup operates. One-hot encoding converts categorical values into binary values (0 or 1) for each category. The one-hot encoded values replace the original column in X. The purpose is to handle categorical data in a format suitable for machine learning models.

Avoiding the Dummy Variable Trap: After one-hot encoding, the code removes one of the dummy variables to avoid the "dummy variable trap." This is done by selecting all columns from the second column onwards in the one-hot encoded X matrix.

Splitting the Dataset: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn. This allows for model training and evaluation on separate datasets. The training set consists of X_train and y_train, while the test set consists of X_test and y_test. The split ratio is 80% for training and 20% for testing.

Feature Scaling: Feature scaling is applied to standardize the independent variables. Standardization ensures that all variables have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This step is important because it helps the regression model converge faster and makes the coefficients more interpretable.

Reshaping y_train: The dependent variable y_train is reshaped into a 2D array-like format using .reshape(-1, 1) to meet the requirements of the StandardScaler. This standardizes the dependent variable.

Fitting Multiple Linear Regression: A multiple linear regression model is created using LinearRegression from scikit-learn, and it is fitted to the training data (X_train and y_train). This step calculates the coefficients for each independent variable.

Predicting the Test Set Results: The trained regression model is used to make predictions on the test set (X_test), and the predicted values are stored in y_pred.

Printing Predicted Values: Finally, the code prints the predicted values (y_pred), which represent the profit predictions for the test set based on the model's coefficients and the independent variables.
